  CH32 Reset and Clock Control (RCC) node.
  This node is in charge of reset control for AHB (Advanced High Performance)
  and APB (Advanced Peripheral) bus domains.

  To specify the reset line in a peripheral, the standard resets property needs
  to be used, e.g.:

    usart1: serial@xxx {
        ...
        /* Cell contains information about RCU register offset and bit */
        resets = <&rctl CH32_RESET(ABP2, 4U)>;
        ...
    };

compatible: "wch,ch32-rctl"
