  single-wire:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the single wire half-duplex communication.
      Using this mode, TX and RX lines are internally connected and
      only TX pin is used afterwards and should be configured.
      RX/TX conflicts must be handled on user side.

  fifo-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables transmit and receive FIFO using default FIFO configuration (typically threshold is
      set to 1/8).
      In TX, FIFO allows to work in burst mode, easing scheduling of loaded applications. It also
      allows more reliable communication with UART devices sensitive to variation of inter-frames
      delays.
      In RX, FIFO reduces overrun occurrences.
